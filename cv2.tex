%\section*{Introduction}
%I am the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the Center for Open Science (COS; \url{http://cos.io}), a non-profit technology company missioned to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scholarly research. As CTO, I am responsible for organizational strategy with a focus on the technical, product vision, software architecture and technical stack of COS products and services, external partner and funder development, and management of COS Labs--COS's research and development team. I also co-lead SHARE (\url{http://share-research.org})--an initiative by the Association of Research Libraries and COS to create a free, open dataset of research activity across the research life-cycle. I have a Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology from the University of Virginia, where I now hold a Visiting Assistant Professor position in the Department of Engineering and Society. My dissertation included the development of the Open Science Frame (\url{http://osf.io})--a free, open source workflow management system and scholarly commons that is now the flagship product of COS.
